#Database Locking

##This project demonstrates two types of database locking mechanisms — Optimistic Locking and Pessimistic Locking — with a focus on booking seats for movies.

Insert Records to Seat Table
INSERT INTO seat (movieName, booked, version) VALUES 
('Inception', false, 0),
('Titanic', false, 0),
('Avengers: Endgame', false, 0),
('Interstellar', false, 0),
('The Dark Knight', false, 0);

#Optimistic Validation

Thread-1 is attempting to book the seat optimistically...
Thread-1 fetched seat with version: 0
Thread-2 is attempting to book the seat optimistically...
Thread-2 fetched seat with version: 0
Thread-1 successfully booked the seat! and version is 1
Thread-2 failed: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): [com.javatechie.entity.Seat#2]

##Step-by-Step Breakdown
Thread-1 and Thread-2 Fetch the Same Seat (Version 0)
Both threads start their tasks:

Thread-1 fetches the Seat entity with version: 0.
Before Thread-1 completes its booking, Thread-2 also fetches the same Seat entity with version: 0.
This is expected behavior because optimistic locking allows multiple threads to read the same entity simultaneously. At this point:

Both threads hold a copy of the entity with version: 0.
Thread-1 Successfully Books the Seat

Thread-1 proceeds to update the seat:
It checks the version of the entity in the database (version: 0) and finds it matches the version it fetched.
The update is successful, and the version of the entity in the database is incremented to 1.
Thread-1 logs:
Thread-1 successfully booked the seat! and version is 1
Thread-2 Fails Due to Version Mismatch

After Thread-1 updates the seat, Thread-2 attempts to update the same seat using its fetched copy (version: 0).
Before updating, the database checks if the version in Thread-2's copy (version: 0) matches the current version in the database (version: 1).
The versions do not match because Thread-1 has already updated the seat.
As a result, Hibernate throws an OptimisticLockingFailureException, indicating that another transaction modified the row since Thread-2 fetched it.
Thread-2 logs:
Thread-2 failed: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): [com.javatechie.entity.Seat#2]

#Pessimistic Locking in Action: Seat Booking Example

##Results
Thread-1 is attempting to fetch the seat with a pessimistic lock...
Thread-2 is attempting to fetch the seat with a pessimistic lock...
Thread-1 acquired the lock for seat ID: 2
Thread-1 is booking the seat...
Thread-1 successfully booked the seat with ID: 2
Thread-2 acquired the lock for seat ID: 2
Thread-2 failed: Seat ID 2 is already booked!
Thread-2 failed: Seat already booked

#Execution Flow and Logs

Thread-1 Attempts to Fetch the Seat

Thread-1 starts first and acquires the lock for the seat (ID 2).
Logs:
Thread-1 is attempting to fetch the seat with a pessimistic lock...
Thread-1 acquired the lock for seat ID: 2
Thread-2 Attempts to Fetch the Seat

While Thread-1 is holding the lock, Thread-2 starts and waits for the lock to be released.
Logs:
Thread-2 is attempting to fetch the seat with a pessimistic lock...
Thread-1 Books the Seat

Thread-1 successfully books the seat and releases the lock at the end of the transaction.
Logs:
Thread-1 is booking the seat...
Thread-1 successfully booked the seat with ID: 2
Thread-2 Acquires the Lock and Fails

After the lock is released, Thread-2 acquires the lock and checks the seat's status.
Since the seat is already booked, Thread-2 fails with an exception.
Logs:
Thread-2 acquired the lock for seat ID: 2
Thread-2 failed: Seat ID 2 is already booked!
Thread-2 failed: Seat already booked
Key Points
##Exclusive Access:
Pessimistic Locking ensures that only one thread can modify the seat at a time by locking it in the database during the transaction.

Sequential Processing:
Threads attempting to access the same entity are processed one after the other, avoiding conflicts and ensuring data consistency.

Failure Handling:
If a thread finds the entity in an invalid state (e.g., already booked), it throws an exception to indicate the operation cannot proceed.
